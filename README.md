# ProjectManagementSystem
Undergraduate project. An MVC Application using ASP.NET and Entity Framework.

Project Goal: Create an application that allows CommerceBank to manage projects that involve university students.

Background: At the time of application development, my experience was limited. I had completed many
toy projects in my courses. However, I hadn't produced a software system that involved software
engineering, API usage, architectural considerations, etc. This was my first major project. You'll
notice that my code doesn't follow any design patterns. I hadn't gone through a course that introduced
me to design patterns at this point, so many strong dependencies are present. The code reveals my 
lack of experience at the time. However, this was a good project and I took on many all-nighters 
to get it finished.
